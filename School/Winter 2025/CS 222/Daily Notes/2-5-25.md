small numbers can go on big numbers but not vice versa

if the user inputs 0 or a negative end the program 

if it only has one it puts it from source to destination sora base case

if 2 it pops first item and puts it to aux then the second element from source to destination then puts the element from aux to dest

with 3 disks
- from source to destination
- from source to aux
- from destination to aux
- from source to destination
- from aux to source 
- from aux to dest
- from source to dest

```
if (numDisks <=0){
	return;
}
recursiveHanoi(numDisks-1, source, aux, dest);
cout << "moved"
recrsiveHanoi(numDisks-1, aux, dest, source)
```

# Algorithm for Hanoi
- number of moves = $2^n - 1$
- start the loop at 1 NOT 0
```
if (i%3==2)
	only legal move between source and aux

// First step
if (i%3==1)
	only legal move between source and dest
	
if (i%3==0)
	only legal move between aux and dest
```
