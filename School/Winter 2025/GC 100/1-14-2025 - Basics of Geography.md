# Five themes of Geography
---
* **==Location==** - There are two types of location absolute and relative
	* Absolute - Things like longitude and latitude or address
	* Relative - Things that give a vague idea of the location 
* **==Region==** - Area defined by uniform characteristics
* **==Human==** - Interactions between human activities and natural environment
* **==Movement==** - Communication, Circulation, Migration and diffusion across Earths surface
* **==Place==** - Human and physical characteristics of a location; tangible and intangible characteristics of that location. 

# Types of Scale
---
* **==Spacial Scale==** - Things that effect the planet on a whole such as a catastrophic volcano eruption that causes colder than typical weather all across the world
* **==Regional Scale==** - Things effect on a region of the earth such as earthquakes in California or hurricanes in the gulf region
* **==Local Scale==** - Things that occur in a small local region such as a town or city 
* **==Temporal Scale==** - The time scale on which processes occur, for instance things that happen every year or even every few minutes.
