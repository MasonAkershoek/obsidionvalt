#hfiles
**h Files** - .h Files contain all the declarations 

### Things that denote program efficiency
- Speed
- File Size
- RAM
- Scalability
- Readability

#Arrays
### Arrays
- time it takes to search an array $O(n)$ using Big O notation
- if many people are accessing the array at the same time the time to search the array becomes $O(n^n)$
- fastest search is binary search as long as the array is sorted with a time of $O(lg(n))$

**Stuff for Program 1**
- Basically, for multiplying two integers represented as strings take the basic multiplication steps
