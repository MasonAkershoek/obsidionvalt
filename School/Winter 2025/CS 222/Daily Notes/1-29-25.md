# Searching algorithms
- Linear Search
	- Scans each element of a data structure till the data being searched for is found
	- sited well for unsorted or small data structures
	- Time Complexity
		- Worst Case: $O(n)$
		- Best Case: $O(1)$
		- Average Case: $O(n/2)$
- Binary Search
	- Efficiently finds element by repeatedly dividing the dataset into halves the data must be sorted
	- works on principle of divide and conquer
	- useful for large datasets 
	- Time Complexity
		- Worst Case: $O(log(n))$
		- Best Case: $O(1)$
		- Average Case: $O(log(n))$
- Interpolation Search 
	- an improvement over Binary Search
	- your data needs to be evenly distributed and sorted for the algorithm to be effective
	- formula for probing position
		-  $pos = low + (\frac{target-arr[low]}{arr[high]-arr[low]}*(high-low))$
	- Time Complexity
		- Worst Case: $O(n)$
		- Best Case: $O(1)$
		- Average Case: $O(log(log(n)))$
