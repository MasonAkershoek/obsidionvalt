- # Vector
	- A vector is a multidimensional quantity, basicly two or more numbers packed togreather
	- A vector implies a basis/space; the vector is a linear combination of the basis vectors
	- ==Multiply Vector== - Multiplying a vector with a scalar just makes the vector longer or shorter. Multiplying by a negitive number will invert the vector making it point the opposite direction
	- ==**Scalar**== - A floating point number used to change the value of a vector
	- In general, a Vector can be thought as a direction and magnitude
	- ==**Magnitude**== of a vector is a scalar value; "How long the vector is" and is calculated using euclidean metric
	- Dividing a vector by its magnitude creates a vector with magnitude 1, called a unit vector. A unit vector will be on the surface of a circle or sphere and represents the direction of the vector
	- **==Dot Product==** - Is a usful function for determiniting the similarity between two vectors. The dot product is the sum of the component wise multiplication
		- if both the operands are unit vectors the dot product is equal to the cosine of the angle between the two.
		- The dot product is an easy way to compare the direction of vectors.
	- we can split a vector into two by projecting to and rejecting from a refrance vector
	- The projection is the direction of the refrance vector and the rejection is orthogonal to the refrance vector.
	- ==**Quaternions**== - Are a 4D extension of the imagina
