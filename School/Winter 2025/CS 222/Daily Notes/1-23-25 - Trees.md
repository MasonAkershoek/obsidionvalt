- # #Tree
	- A tree is kind of like a linked list but with different choices of next node
	- no real end node
	- parent node is the node that points to it
	- and a node can have a list of children
	- a leaf is a node with no children
	- a branch is a node with at least one child
	- Depth of a node is how many jumps from the root it take to reach the desired node
	- subtroo -  if we take a node N in the tree we treat it as the root of a tree
	- Height - the number of nodes in the longest path from root to leaf
	- layer - all nodes that are of the same height of depth in a tree
	- # #Binary_Tree
		- In a binary tree a node will have at most 2 children
		- you want trees to be "Balanced" meaning that most of the layers are full
		- a balanced tree has a time complexity of $O(log(n))$
		- an unbalanced tree could be as bad as $O(n)$
