- **Waves**
	- Shortwave
	- long wage
	- Gamma - Used in cancer treatment
	- X-ray - Used to take pictures of Bones
	- ultraviolet - What we use to tan, sent by the sun
	- Visible Light - what humans and most animals see
	- Near inferred, middle inferred, thermal inferred
	- microwaves - Used in microwaves obviously
	- radio waves - We use these to broadcast radio and for communication between electronic devices
	- The sun outputs shortwave energy and the earth outputs long wave energy

- **insolation**
	- Solar energy that arives at the earths surface and atmosphere. Units are watts per sq. m
	- insolation received at the earths surface is unevenly distributed due to its curvature
	- Solar
	- Incoming
	- Solar
	- Radiation

- **Seasonality**
	- Variations in the suns position above the horizon and changing day lengths during the year

- Subsolar point - the point on the earths surface that the sun is directly over. Makes shadows point straight down
