- # Stack
	- ==**Push**== - Putting something on the stack
	- ==**Pop**== - Taking something off the stack
	- ==**First In Last Out**==  - Meaning that the first item added to the stack must also be the last one to be retrieved form the stack
	- To sort any stack you need at least 3 stacks, the most efficient way is to have $n-1$ stacks
